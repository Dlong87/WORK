SPLUNK BASICS

Events:
    |--> single entry of data and can have one or multiple lines
          event can be text document, a configuration file, or entire stack trace

          "173.26.34.223 - - [01/ Mar/2021:12:05:27 -0700] “GET /trade/ app?action=logout HTTP/1.1” 200 2953"

Metrics:
    |--> consists of a timestamp and one or more measurements. It can also contain dimensions
          Mesurements- a metric name and corresponding numeric value (Prperties)
          Dimensions- provide additional information about the measurements (characteristics)

          
Events with the same sourcetypes can come from different sources 
source=/var/log/messages    (different source of info)

source=UDP:514    (different source of info)

sourcetype=linux_syslog (same sourcetype as linux uses both UDP port:514 for remote logging)


Fields:
    |--> searchable name and value pairings that distinguish one event from another

Tags:
    |--> a knowledge object that enables you to search for events that contain particular field values. You can assign one or more tags to any field/value combination, including event types, hosts, sources, and source types
          Knowledge object- (user-defined entity that helps enrich and organize data within the platform)
                            (allow users to extract meaningful insights from raw data)

          example of a knowledge object- Saved searches, Event types, Tags & field extractions

indexes:
    |--> data is stored in the “main” index

Reports:
    |--> set a scheduled report to generate alerts when the results meet particular conditions. Reports can be added to dashboards as dashboard panels
          Dashboard- (made up of panels that contain modules such as search boxes, fields, and data visualizations.)  usually connected to seaved searches 
          Alerts- ( triggered when search results meet specific conditions)


SYSTEM COMPONENTS:

forwarders:
    |--> Splunk instance that forwards data to another Splunk instance
    

Indexers:
    |--> transforms the raw data into events and stores the events into an index, also searches the indexed data in response to search requests


Search Head:
    |--> distributed search environment, directs search requests to a set of search peers and merges the results back to the user

head/tail- Returns the first/last N results.                                                                                                        

search- Filters results to those that match the search expression.

sort- Sorts the search results by the specified fields.

stats- Provides statistics, grouped optionally by fields.  See COMMON STATS FUNCTIONS.

where- Filters search results using eval expressions. Used to  compare two different fields.


strftime(X,Y)
    |--> Returns epochtime value X rendered using the format specified by Y.
    EXAMPLE-- strftime(_time, "%H:%M")

    TIME:
        |--> %H (24 hour (leading zeros) (00 to 23))
              %I 12 hour (leading zeros) (01 to 12)
              %M Minute (00 to 59)
              %S Second (00 to 61)
              %N subseconds with width (%3N = millisecs, %6N = microsecs, %9N = nanosecs)    REALLY NOT NESSESARY BUT I PUT IT ON HERE ANYWAY
              %p AM or PM
              %Z Time zone (EST)    AGAIN THIS SHIT ISNT NESSESARY
              %z Time zone offset from UTC, in hour and minute: +hhmm or -hhmm. (-0500 for EST) THIS SHIT ALSO ISNT NESSEARY EITHER 
              %s Seconds since 1/1/1970 (1308677092)

    DAYS:
        |--> %d Day of month (leading zeros) (01 to 31)
              %j Day of year (001 to 366)
              %w Weekday (0 to 6)
              %a Abbreviated weekday (Sun)
              %A Weekday (Sunday)

    MONTHS:
        |--> %b Abbreviated month name (Jan)
              %B Month name (January)
              %m Month number (01 to 12)

    YEARS:
        |--> %y Year without century (00 to 99)
             %Y Year (2021)
