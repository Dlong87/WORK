SPLUNK BASICS

Events:
    |--> single entry of data and can have one or multiple lines
          event can be text document, a configuration file, or entire stack trace

          "173.26.34.223 - - [01/ Mar/2021:12:05:27 -0700] “GET /trade/ app?action=logout HTTP/1.1” 200 2953"

Metrics:
    |--> consists of a timestamp and one or more measurements. It can also contain dimensions
          Mesurements- a metric name and corresponding numeric value (Prperties)
          Dimensions- provide additional information about the measurements (characteristics)

          
Events with the same sourcetypes can come from different sources 
source=/var/log/messages    (different source of info)

source=UDP:514    (different source of info)

sourcetype=linux_syslog (same sourcetype as linux uses both UDP port:514 for remote logging)


Fields:
    |--> searchable name and value pairings that distinguish one event from another

Tags:
    |--> a knowledge object that enables you to search for events that contain particular field values. You can assign one or more tags to any field/value combination, including event types, hosts, sources, and source types
          Knowledge object- (user-defined entity that helps enrich and organize data within the platform)
                            (allow users to extract meaningful insights from raw data)

          example of a knowledge object- Saved searches, Event types, Tags & field extractions

indexes:
    |--> data is stored in the “main” index

Reports:
    |--> set a scheduled report to generate alerts when the results meet particular conditions. Reports can be added to dashboards as dashboard panels
          Dashboard- (made up of panels that contain modules such as search boxes, fields, and data visualizations.)  usually connected to seaved searches 
          Alerts- ( triggered when search results meet specific conditions)


SYSTEM COMPONENTS:

forwarders:
    |--> Splunk instance that forwards data to another Splunk instance. Two main types within splunk
            Universal (UF):   minimal-footprint agent designed to forward raw data efficiently. 
            Heavy (HF):    more advanced forwarder that can filter, transform, and route data before sending it.

                1. Data Collection: Forwarder gathers logs, metrics, or events from various sources like servers, applications, or network devices.
                2. Preprocessing: It can tag metadata (source, sourcetype, host), compress data, and buffer it before transmission.
                3. Secure Transmission: Data is sent securely via SSL encryption to a Splunk indexer or another forwarder.
                4. Indexing & Search: The indexer processes the data, making it searchable for analysis and visualization.

        # Highly scalable and resource-efficient, making them ideal for large deployments
    
Indexers:
    |--> transforms the raw data into events and stores the events into an index, also searches the indexed data in response to search requests

                1. Data Ingestion: The indexer receives raw data from forwarders or other sources
                2. Parsing & Event Processing: It breaks the data into events based on timestamps and applies metadata (host, source, sourcetype).
                3. Indexing Pipeline: Events are segmented for fast searching and stored in indexes.
                4. Storage & Compression: The indexer writes raw data and index files to disk, applying compression for efficiency.
                5. Search & Retrieval: When a user runs a search, the indexer quickly retrieves relevant events using optimized indexing structures.

        # Can be clustered for redundancy and scalability, ensuring high availability and data replication

Search Head:
    |--> distributed search environment, directs search requests to a set of search peers and merges the results back to the user

                1. Search Distribution: The search head sends queries to multiple indexers, which process the data and return results.
                2. Parallel Processing: Indexers work simultaneously, speeding up searches.
                3. Search Head Clustering: Multiple search heads can be grouped together to share configurations and load balance searches
                4. Search Artifacts & Replication: Search heads store search results, dashboards, and reports, ensuring consistency across the cluster
                5. User Interface: The search head provides a web-based UI for users to interact with Splunk and visualize data.

        # Crucial for large-scale Splunk deployments, ensuring efficient data retrieval and analysis
