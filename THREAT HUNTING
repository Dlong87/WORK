                    identify the priorites, learn them and how they can be affected

UNDERSTAND THE ENVIRONMENT:
    |--> gather and vailidate network information
          establish a baseline of the network

IDENTIFY REQUIRED DATA SOURCES:
    |--> gather logs/data based on TTP (TACTIC, TECHNIQES, PROCEDURES) 
          Host-based: Win EventLogs, Sysmon, EDR telemetery
          Net-based: Zeek, PCAPs, flow data
          OSR: virustotal, threat intel platforms

TOOLING SETUP:
    |--> Host Analysis: Hayabusa, Chainsaw, Timesketch, Multi-user Autopsy 
          Threat Detection: YARA, Zeeks (intel.dat)
          Case Managment:  Notetaking systems, internal ticketing/case tracking tools
